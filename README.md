# erik_burger_genome_analysis
The aim of this project is to assemble the genome of from the fruit Durian (Durio zibethinus) and then to annotate the genome. The transcriptome form different parts of the fruit will be assembled to study the differences in expression. If time is available the gene expression in the durian fruit will also be compared to the expression in other fruits. :shipit:

Some of the analyses will take longer time than others. For example the first assembly of the PacBio reads will take approximately 17 hours and if I decide to try to run the assembly with different parameters it would take a lot longer. Sine That is quite an essential analysis to progress in the project it can be seen as a bottleneck since it will be so time dependent.
